                <p>As designers, we learn by making. Rather than planning out our ideas perfectly, we build our half-baked sketches to uncover insights and pain points that theory alone can’t provide. We act quickly on our ideas because their strengths and weaknesses only emerge once they take shape in the real world.</p>

                <p>Rapid prototyping can be uncomfortable. However, bringing our ideas into reality—be it through a sketch, a mock-up, or a low-fidelity model—helps us move quickly from abstraction to tangibility. Making turns thinking into evidence. It grounds our ideas in the context they’ll actually exist in. Especially when we work with large teams across different disciplines, a prototype is a shared object that better communicates our thoughts, clarifies our intent, and invites feedback. If we’re creating a data dashboard for clinicians, we can start by sketching a few layout options and testing them early to see what information they actually need. That way, when changes come up, we’re only revising sketches rather than rewriting code.</p>

                <p>The real power in making our ideas early is our ability to test them in the real world. The stakes of failure are low because messy prototypes are cheap to make, easy to change, and designed to surface insights before we invest in a final form. In fact, failure is an asset because it’s an opportunity to learn more about the problem and get closer to the solution. If we are truly in love with the problem, then we won’t feel sentimental about scrapping ideas we thought might work when the prototype tells us they will not. An essential skill of a design thinker is the ability to ruthlessly self-evaluate and discard ideas that we thought would work. We pivot.</p>

                <p>Think about a designer like a sculptor carving into marble. Our first moves are broad and imperfect, but each one exposes new contours of the problem. They will address many of the parts of the problem, but even after we carve off big pieces of the marble, it’s still just a hunk of rock. But, as we continue to make smaller and smaller moves, we refine our way to a beautiful sculpture. Design functions the same way. As we make our ideas real, test them, and act on the feedback we receive, we’ll arrive at an optimal solution. The first moves are the hardest to make but from those come the necessary feedback that allows us to make the refined, detailed moves. This circular process of making, gathering feedback, and remaking is the rhythm of design.</p>

                <p>When we iterate, we accept that solutions are never done. Designing living solutions is like chasing a moving bullseye. We change our point of view, direction, or even our outcome based on what we’ve learned from making. Accepting failure and embracing iteration is the only way to hit a moving target. By embracing iteration and reframing failure as discovery, we can continually refine our ideas and respond to our communities with precision and humility. Iteration is what keeps empathy and co-creation alive over time. It’s the practice of returning, refining, and remaking—transforming communication from a fixed message into an evolving dialogue with the people we serve.</p>

            <h2><i>iHeard</i> St. Louis's Iterative Spirit</h2>
            <article class="content-text">
                <p class="intro-text"><i>iHeard</i>’s content changes every week—but its visual design system evolved over a much longer timeline.</p>
                
                <p>Each week, once new health communication priorities are set, our team designs graphics for <i>iHeard</i> St. Louis’s social channels and trusted community partners. In the project’s early days, <i>iHeard</i>’s graphics were created with a pared-back design system: just a handful of main colors, a set of illustrations, and basic typographic styles. As <i>iHeard</i> matured, we began to track the performance of each graphic—impressions, likes, comments, shares—alongside which visual features were present. After sixteen months, we could see clear signals in the data about what drove community engagement. The most consistent finding: graphics featuring pictures or illustrations of people always performed better. That insight led us to grow our design system to include more human imagery, and engagement climbed. Humor, too, resonated—prompting our annual Valentine’s Day campaign with playful public health puns. (“Are you doing 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily? Because you get my heart pumping!”)</p>

                <p>But the most powerful engagement driver was local relevance. Posts that highlighted recognizable local leaders, landmarks, or organizations performed best—reinforcing our philosophy of locally-attuned empathy. As <i>iHeard</i> expanded into communities beyond St. Louis, these findings guided our approach: we developed color palettes that fit each place, chose imagery referencing local icons, and tailored content to local needs and knowledge gaps.</p>
                
                <p>We also learned, by listening to our partners, that some trusted messengers preferred physical print materials for sharing health information in their spaces. Our design team responded by creating posters and handouts adapted to community sites. By staying open to feedback and embracing change, we broadened how and where <i>iHeard</i>’s message was shared.</p>
                
                <p>Iteration and evaluation are built into <i>iHeard</i>’s DNA. The weekly rhythm of the survey ensures that <i>iHeard</i>’s content is always responding to the most pressing local health knowledge needs. If something happens in our community, we can reflect it in the narrative and graphics within a week. We track each health priority over time, adapting our communication as risks rise or subside. When misinformation begins to dissipate, we confidently shift away from it; when new challenges emerge, we meet them head-on.</p>

                <p>This commitment to ongoing evaluation and iterative design transformed <i>iHeard</i>’s visual identity and content into a dynamic system—one created in partnership with the communities it supports.</p>
