                <p>Co-creation is grounded in the belief that the solutions to big problems already exist within the communities we aim to serve—our job as designers is to uncover them together. If we’re designing communication about AIDS, for instance, we should work directly with gay men to ensure the messaging is relevant and useful. In the 1980s, the U.S. government issued AIDS messages from the top down, and they failed because they ignored the experiences and insight of the gay men living through the epidemic. When gay men stepped in and created their own communication efforts through organizations like ACT UP, the messaging finally reflected lived experience and started to resonate.</p>
                
                <p>Formally, co-design is a collaborative approach to problem solving in which trained designers work alongside non-designers—often the intended beneficiaries—to jointly define problems, generate ideas, and create solutions. It spans the entire design process from ideation to final product to ensure the solution is contextually relevant and serves the actual needs of its target audience. In short, co-design forces designers out of our ivory towers (or, our studios) and into the world where our solutions will live.</p>
                
                <p>The idea of co-creation is not new to public health communicators. By bringing communities into our entire design process, we share the decision making power and give them agency in shaping the solutions that will affect them. This means trusting that users are not passive recipients of our work but active co-creators capable of contributing to every stage—from defining the problem to generating ideas to evaluating results.</p>
                
                <p>We reject the idea that expertise alone produces the best answers. Instead, we rely on the power of collaboration and lived experience. Rather than prescribing solutions onto a community, we can work with them to fully articulate their needs. The designer-audience relationship is reciprocal: we gain insight and ideas from them, and in return, we turn that insight into solutions that respond to real problems. This partnership builds trust and empathy, making our solutions stronger and more sustainable.</p>
                
                <p>Co-creation can transform public health communication from a practice of persuasion into one of partnership, building trust and empathy along the way.</p>

            <h2><i>iHeard</i> St. Louis Community Panel</h2>
            <article class="content-text">
                
                <p>At the heart of <i>iHeard</i> lies our community panel. This 200-person community panel is the foundation of the project—it guides our direction, ensuring that <i>iHeard</i> remains responsive to what people in St. Louis are hearing, thinking, and saying about health. The panel is both a source of knowledge and a feedback loop that keeps <i>iHeard</i> close to the community we’re serving.</p>

                <p>In co-design, we work with a small slice of the community rather than the whole, so it’s vital that the sample truly reflects the range of perspectives we hope to serve. A lot of thought was put into recruiting a well-rounded panel of community members who could help <i>iHeard</i> really meet the needs of the entire community. Recruitment of the panel members initially occurred through community partner organizations who leveraged their networks of individuals and families that they served. This was supplemented by in-person panel recruitment and community events. Because the goal of the project was to serve underrepresented community members in St. Louis City, we intentionally recruited a panel with a higher proportion of African Americans. The panel was also initially half composed of front-line workers, as they interface with community members most often and therefore have a unique view into what is going on.</p>

                <p><i>iHeard</i>’s co-creation is not a one-time consultation but an ongoing relationship with community members. Every week we check in with them through the survey to hear what they are hearing, making sure we’re responsive to their health knowledge needs in near real time. Each week’s survey content is a result of panel responses from previous weeks—past responses from the community influence future survey questions.</p>

                <p>Unlike other infodemiological projects, <i>iHeard</i> learns about the spread of health knowledge through our relationships with community members. The relationship between panel members and <i>iHeard</i> is reciprocal. In return for their time and input, panel members are financially compensated. In addition, as they fill out the weekly survey, they are given accurate health information and are fulfilled knowing their input is making their community a healthier place to live.</p>

                <p>This partnership model—where community members are not just informants but co-creators—ensures that <i>iHeard</i> remains both credible and human-centered. In practice, the panel embodies the idea that trust in public health communication grows when communities are not simply spoken to, but spoken with.</p>
