                <p>Design thinking is about casting our vision for an ideal future and then doing something to make it a reality. In this context, design is an iterative, systematic, and exploratory methodology to solve complex problems. It’s not about how things look at all. It is a way of thinking about the world—a mindset—and anyone with this mindset can approach the world like a designer—especially public health communicators. In that way, we are all designers. You, too, are a designer.</p>
                
                <p>Design assumes that even the biggest problems—promoting vaccination, rebuilding trust in public health institutions, or addressing the opioid crisis—are solvable and we as designers believe that those solutions lie with the people who are experiencing them every day. At its core, design is an optimistic endeavor. It asks us to believe that trying, making, iterating, and learning will get us closer to a world that better supports people’s needs. Design thinking asks us to trust that forward motion and keep moving.</p>
                
                <p>We are in the business of empathy. We suspend our assumptions, listen before suggesting, and respect the perspectives of the people who live with the realities we aim to improve. Without empathy, design is guesswork. With empathy, design becomes grounded, relevant, and trustworthy. Historically, public health communication has been about disseminating health information with the goal of persuasion. We’ve used non-direct channels like print or TV news media. We have spoken to communities, not with them. This top-down approach never fully earned trust, but today, its limitations are more obvious than ever.</p>
                
                <p>We need a radical shift. We need to transform public health from a practice of persuasion into a practice of partnership. To rebuild trust in public health communication, we must design with communities, not for them. Design thinking is a toolkit for doing so—our solutions will be anchored in empathy and local understanding, sustained through co-creation and shared ownership, and advanced by iterative making. Together, these pillars transform communication from a linear act of information delivery into an adaptive, trust-building process rooted in listening, partnership, and continuous improvement.</p>

            <h2>The <i>iHeard</i> St. Louis Story</h2>
            <article class="content-text">
                <p class="intro-text">How does information about health enter and spread through a community?</p>
                
                <p><i>iHeard</i> is a health knowledge monitoring and response tool that aims to build trust in science by tracking how health information circulates through a community. In the same way that traditional population health surveillance monitors the spread of diseases like tuberculosis or the flu, we track the spread of health information. This approach reflects the growing field of infodemiology—the study of how information circulates within populations and influences public health outcomes. By treating information as something that can spread through a community like a pathogen, we use infodemiological principles to identify emerging narratives early and guide timely, evidence-based responses.</p>

                <p><i>iHeard</i> was born in St. Louis as a rapid-response information system during the COVID era, not as a planned research project. Because of the urgency of that moment, <i>iHeard</i> had to be completely responsive: able to listen, analyze, and respond as new narratives and guidance surfaced in near real-time. From the beginning, it brought together WashU’s Health Communication Research Lab (led by Matt Kreuter) and the Health Communication Design Studio (led by Penina Laker). That partnership let <i>iHeard</i> develop as a design-driven public communication health project.</p>

                <p>Each week, <i>iHeard</i> sends a three-minute survey to about 200 community members, asking what health information they have heard in the past week. Unlike other infodemiological projects that primarily scrape sentiment from social media and news, we go directly to the community. We analyze community responses to identify weekly health information priorities and falsehood threats, then respond to the community by sharing plain language, accurate health information resources that we share on social media, via an online dashboard, and with partners to share through their local channels.</p>

                <p>By tracking community health knowledge week by week, <i>iHeard</i> provides a real-time pulse on health knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs circulating within St. Louis. This awareness enables the public health infrastructure and health care professionals to better tailor their communication and care to real community needs—building trust, improving understanding, and driving better health outcomes.</p>

                <p>At its core, <i>iHeard</i> is a platform for design thinking. We embrace the principles of design: making quickly, testing early, and iterating often. By treating each cycle of feedback as an opportunity to refine both message and method, we stay adaptable in a constantly changing information environment, where accuracy, timing, and trust are all critical.</p>

                <p><i>iHeard</i> is transforming public health communication from a static, top-down process into an evolving, participatory practice centered on empathy, iteration, and responsiveness.</p>
