                <p><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:400;">Design and public health share a belief that progress is possible. Both fields operate on the assumption that small, steady improvements add up to real change. The following is a transcript from a conversation between myself (MG) and Dean Sandro Galea (SG), the Margaret C. Ryan Dean of the School of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis. It has been edited for clarity.</span></p>

                <div class="conversation">
                    <p><strong>MG:</strong> Traditional public health operates from expert authority: "We know what's best for population health." Design thinking decentralizes expertise: "The people experiencing the problem are experts in their own lives." Can both be true? Should both be true?</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> They both can be true. They both have to be true at the same time. It is equally true that there is such a thing as expertise, that there are people who are trained to know a lot of things about some things. But it is also true that people themselves perceive problems and they have ideas for solving them. We struggle with this around ideas of public health but we don’t struggle with this in our plumbing. I don’t want my plumbing to be crowdsourced, I want an expert in plumbing to fix my plumbing. At the same time, I actually know which stems are dripping and which stems are driving me crazy.</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> So, expertise is—should be—a core part of how we operate societies, that we can’t all be experts in everything, and we invest in some people to develop expertise. But at the same time, I think that expertise can become arrogant and lose sight of what people really care about. I think it's true in clinical medicine, it’s true in plumbing, and it’s true in public health.</p>

                    <p><strong>MG:</strong> What role can you imagine design playing in supporting public health professionals to implement new technologies like AI or advanced data science to serve our communities more effectively?</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> Design is a way of representing and seeing the world, right? So I think that we need design to organize the world in a way that we can understand it. And in so far as improving the health of the population means understanding the levers in the world around us that are at our disposal to create a world where people can live longer, healthier lives.</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> Design is a component of that in that it helps us structure the multiple and manifold inputs into a way that can make sense, so we can determine what it is we can act on. I care very much about design and about organizing the world because that is the way in which we can actually advance the world where we try to find data to inform particular actions and move those actions going forward.</p>

                    <p><strong>MG:</strong> Design is an inherently optimistic endeavor—we wouldn’t try to solve a problem if we didn’t think a solution existed. What population-level health issues that we face today do you think could be completely solved in a decade with design thinking?</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> The notion of low hanging fruit is a mistake. If there were low hanging fruit it would have been picked already. The business of building a world where everyone can live longer, healthier lives is the business of constant adjusting and readjusting, of constant data-finding, of constant trying to do something better.</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> It’s a little bit like a metaphor of being on a stand up paddle board on a lake. You can stand up on it, but when you’re standing up, what are you doing? You’re constantly adjusting your feet. Because microadjustments—that’s the only way to actually make it happen. We’re dealing in such a complex system that something changes and what we do changes. I don’t know if there is something we can say that can realistically be achieved in 10 years.  It’s good to have radical visions and aspirations but the work of public health is the hard incremental work of doing things  step by step to make them happen.</p>

                    <p><strong>MG:</strong> What makes you optimistic about the future of public health?</p>

                    <p><strong>SG:</strong> The world is better today than it was yesterday, than it was 10 years ago, than it was 50 years ago. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You would rather choose to be alive today than to be alive 50 years ago. All the look back, the romantic nostalgia, is hooey. The world had more structural racism, had worse access to health, and had more cruelty 50 years ago than it is today.  </p>
