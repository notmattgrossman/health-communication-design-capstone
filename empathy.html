                <p>Empathy asks us to suspend our assumptions about others’ experiences and trust them to define their own needs. In design, empathy is our ability to understand our audience, communicate effectively, and meet their needs—even the ones they may not yet recognize themselves. We can only learn about the full scope of a problem when we look at it from other people’s perspective. We get to know problems like we get to know people: with patience, curiosity, and openness. There is no final state of completely knowing a problem. The more time we spend with it, the more its hidden contours emerge. We fall in love with the problem and not our solutions.</p>
                
                <p>If we’re solving problems with empathy as our mindset, we have many tools at our disposal to make that mindset tangible. Designers often start by interviewing community members and looking for patterns across their experiences. For larger efforts, we can bring people together through structured panels that advise and shape the work. Facilitating these interviews and panels is itself a practice in empathy, because it brings community members into the creative process and grounds our decisions in their lived realities. These practices are intertwined with co-design, which we’ll talk about in the next section.</p>
                
                <p>Empathy’s power is in building trust and proximity with audiences. Designers are in the business of making useful things for other people—we respond to context. Understanding social systems is central to our work.</p>
                
                <p>Research has established that people trust their local health organizations more than national ones. In public health communication, empathy is most possible when it’s local. When strategies are rooted in community context and experiences, we can build a stronger, enduring trust with our communities. When the target audience is a city- or county-wide population, it’s much easier to practice empathy than when we target an entire country. Local institutions are more resilient to the swinging pendulum of politics that have crept into our national public health institutions. Building local public health infrastructure is a great way to approach the headwinds at the national level. We can bring down the temperature on public health by adjusting our approach in each community—what works in Austin won’t necessarily work in Boston. Local institutions understand the local context better. </p>
                
                <p>When we are close to the ground, we can pick up on subtle shifts, emerging narratives, or context-specific challenges that a national lens might miss. Credibility is established when health information feels close, accessible, and grounded in local context. Proximity builds trust. </p>

            <h2><i>iHeard</i> St. Louis's Hyperlocal Approach</h2>
            <article class="content-text">
                <p><i>iHeard</i> is the nation’s first hyperlocal health information tracking system. Its focus on St. Louis allows us to understand and respond to health information at a level of granularity that broader programs cannot. When local events occur that affect community health—such as a series of intense weather events met with limited government response—<i>iHeard</i> can quickly detect shifts in public sentiment and address emerging needs through targeted communication.</p>

                <p>A cornerstone of our approach is partnering with trusted messengers—community-serving organizations that already have strong relationships with the people we aim to reach. Trusted messenger organizations range from local health departments and community nonprofits to faith-based institutions and neighborhood groups. These partnerships allow <i>iHeard</i>’s messages to travel through channels that residents already know and trust. Also, trusted messengers are crucial to increasing the odds that people encounter accurate information multiple times from different sources that they already trust.</p>

                <p>Because <i>iHeard</i> is deeply embedded within St. Louis’s public health ecosystem through our partnerships with local organizations, they will often turn to us when new needs arise. Through the recent expansion of our trusted messenger network via the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) collaboration, <i>iHeard</i> now supports partners in understanding how well their services are known within the community. For example, when the Dunnica Sobering Support Center (DSSC) learned that many residents were unaware of its services, the organization worked with <i>iHeard</i> to change that. Together, we coordinated a social media day of sharing focused on the Center’s resources, ensuring that community members who needed support knew where to find it. With a clearer sense of how the community understood their services, the DSSC could refine their messaging to meet people where they were.</p> 

                <p>By focusing on hyperlocal collaboration and trust, <i>iHeard</i> strengthens the connection between public health infrastructure and the people it serves—turning health communication into an active, community-driven dialogue.</p>
